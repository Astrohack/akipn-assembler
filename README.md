# Assembly/Borland C++ Projects for DOS

Welcome to the most cutting-edge, next-generation, revolutionary collection of projects ever created... in the 80s. This repository contains several simple programs written in Assembly and Borland C++ for DOS, all part of an unforgettable journey through the subject of Computer Architecture.

## Features

- **Assembly Programming**: Dive deep into the abyss of low-level programming where every byte counts.
- **Borland C++**: Because nothing screams "modern development" like Borland C++ for DOS.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this time-traveling adventure, make sure you have the following:

- A DOS emulator like [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) or, if you're feeling adventurous, an actual DOS machine from the past millennium.
- Borland C++ installed on your system, which you can find in the archives of history.

## Installation

1. Clone this relic of a repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Astrohack/akipn-assembler.git
    cd akipn-assembler
    ```

2. Fire up your DOS environment.

## Running the Projects

To compile and run the projects, follow these steps:

### For Assembly Projects

1. Assemble the code with your favorite assembler (TASM, MASM, or whatever you can find):

    ```bash
    tasm file.asm
    tlink file.obj
    file.exe
    ```

2. Revel in the glory of your blinking cursor or whatever output you manage to conjure up.

### For Borland C++ Projects

1. Open your Borland C++ environment.

2. Load the project files and compile them.

3. Run the executable and witness the magic (or lack thereof).

## Project List

- **Project 2**: Add up two digits including negative ones.
- **Project 3**: Hybrid program, part in c asks user for input and invokes procedures written in assembly language.
- **Project 4**: Load .bmp image and make some magic with it - change contrast, brighteness, negation and thresholding.
